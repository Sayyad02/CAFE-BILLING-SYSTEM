The purpose of this system is to reduce human errors, speed up the billing process, and provide customers with an accurate and professional receipt.
This project is a simple ‘Cafe Billing System’ designed to manage customer orders at a cafe.
It calculates the total bill based on selected items, applies tax, and generates a printable bill with an itemized breakdown. 
The system also includes the option to reset the form to clear previous inputs and start fresh.
The goal is to provide an efficient, user-friendly way for cafes to manage orders and generate receipts.
